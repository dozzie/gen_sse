== mod_sse ==

mod_sse is a module implementing server side of Server-Sent Events protocol
(http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/) for HTTP server supplied by Erlang/OTP
(inets/httpd).

The module was written as a low-dependency proof of concept for something to
be run behind nginx 1.2, later extended to be a little more generic
(i.e. parametrized).
